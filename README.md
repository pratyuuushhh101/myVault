myVault is a security-first, multi-user banking engine built with Django and React that allows users to manage multiple accounts with complete data isolation. It features atomic transactions to ensure money transfers are fail-safe and uses JWT authentication for professional-grade identity protection. The system is production-ready, integrating a PostgreSQL cloud database on AWS to handle real-world financial data integrity.
